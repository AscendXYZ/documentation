We support either signup with LinkedIn (external accounts) or creating your own username and password (we will refer to this as a local account). Visiting https://portal.ascend.xyz you will be presented with either of the two above screens, depending on if you have successfully signed in before. 

## LinkedIn
For using your LinkedIn account please navigate to https://portal.ascend.xyz and click the LinkedIn icon, this will take you to LinkedIn where you are asked to give consent and when coming back to the sign up formula, we have pre-filled it with the information we could get from linkedIn as seen in the image here:

## Local Accounts

You can navigate directly to https://portal.ascend.xyz/#try-ascend-xyz for creating a local account and the process is similar to the above steps for social accounts. The only difference is that you need to provide all the information your self.

In step two of local accounts, we also need you to login at the identity server with the username and password, that you just created.

We will in future releases work on integrating the identity server to the general UX design of the portal, but for now bear with us. 


##Subscriptions

Continuing the flow, it will slide right to the create subscription formula. If you intend to get your identity added to an existing subscription from your company, then you may continue to the verify email section and close the browser at this stage. We will be adding subscription owner identity in a future release. This role can add new to their existing subscription.

After succesfully accessing a subscription you can continue to the verify email section.


##Verify Email

Before being able to complete the login to your dashboard you must have verified your email account by clicking a link that we send to the email account you entered when signing up. We encourage you to put ascend.xyz and ascendxyz.com domains on your safe senders lists to not miss any important mails from us.

Until your email has been verified, you will meet the following verification screen that also allows you to resend your verification link.

In those cases where your email program opens the links in a different browser than what you started the signup process in, you will be send to the identity server and prompted to login again. Its important that you use the same kind of login that you started the flow with. E.g., if you started using your linkedIn profile you need to press the linkedIn button at the right. If using local accounts with a username and password, you need to enter those and press log in.



## Dashboard
When successfully authenticated to the portal you should see this dashboard.
