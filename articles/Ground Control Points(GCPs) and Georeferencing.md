#Ground Control Points(GCPs) and Georeferencing - explained.
When Ascend processes your images and makes them into a beautiful map, we use ground control points to place that map in the world. This is important if you want to display your map on top another or if you need to be able to read precise GPS-coordinates from the map.

You don’t need to use ground control points if you will not be using your map as stated above. But don’t worry, your map will still be internally correct and look great.

There are two different ways for us to obtain GCPs. We can either use a reference-map, such as Google or BING, or you can provide us with GCPs and photos that describe the exact positions of the where the individual GCPs were recorded.
In the first case, your map will have the approximate precision of the source map. In the second, your map will be georeferenced in accordance with the gear that you used for recording the GPS coordinates.

So, if you want to be able to read out GPS coordinates in your new map or have the map placed on top another map, e.g. on a web-site, we recommend that you use GCPs. If you just want to show the map or use it for print, you don’t need GCPs.
