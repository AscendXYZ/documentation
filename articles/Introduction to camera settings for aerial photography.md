#Introduction to camera settings for aerial photography
##For Nikon D800-810
This document describes how we at AscendXYZ prefers to set up our cameras for aerial photos at different GSDs (Ground Sampling Distance). There is not one right setting that fit all needs, so some continuous adjusting will be necessary to get the absolute best out of your system. 
Here are a few ‘rule-of-thumb’-guidelines that are nice to remember before you start to play around with the settings.

  * Get the focus right.
  * Setting the shutter time (1/3200 – 1/1600)
  * Choosing the right aperture (2 to 2.5)
  * Choosing the right ISO setting (100-400)
  
##Lens Settings
The lens needs to be of the ‘single focal length’-type. This means that you can’t use a lens with zoom function.
A good all round focal length is a 50mm. A 50mm lens can be used for most regular aerial jobs.
If you will be doing a lot of high resolution jobs, a lens with a higher focal length might be a good investment. For GSD 4 and under, an 80mm lens is a good focal length. This results in a higher flight altitude for high resolutions.
For low resolution jobs (GSD 15 and above), a good focal length is 35mm. This results in a lower flight altitude for low resolutions. We don’t recommend you use a lens lower than 35mm, it can affect the image quality, especially in the periphery of the images.
