#Images, Tiles and Storage Size


A key element of being able to leverage a high performing and scaling software as a service that enable you as a user to use browser based clients for inspecting your data is tiling.

Many of AscendXYZ clients rely on images being pre tiles and whenever you as a user chooses to use some of your data in our clients, we will provide you with the options to tile your data up.

In most cases this means that users should expect that when providing their own data to generate these tiles, that the storage space uses is twice than what they have on disk normally. 
To reduce storage size and price for the end user we will provide methods that enables users to have more control on this by retention policies. This means that you can setup policies for when data should be deleted and regenerated on demand.
Another option is also to delete the original data uploaded after a model has been generated.
