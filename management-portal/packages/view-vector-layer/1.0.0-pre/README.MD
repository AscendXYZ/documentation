##Provides a overview lens that shows vector layers.
This package adds lenses such that GPX,GeoJSON and KML files can be opened and the user can see a preview of the vector data inside it.

Its intended for small vector layers that can be uploaded diectly to the plaform and also those vector layers that will be created with the currently in development Create Vector Layer package.

This is a prerelease package that gives our users who install the package the option to see where we are going and also provide feedback back to us.
