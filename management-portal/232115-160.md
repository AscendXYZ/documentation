## Changes
* Added reset password self service

* Optimized the upload experience and fixed a few UI issues.
* Added a portal information blade with version number. (Found in upper right corner-> profile context menu -> settings) This way you can verify that you are on the latest version listed in our [releases](releases.md) 

## Packages
The following packages have been added
### AscendXYZ Documents: Map Catalog 1.0.0 
This package has been added as the first prototype on how AscendXYZ WebMaps will be accessible in the portal from an .axyz file. We are currently testing this package with a few of our users and planning on providing more users with .axyz files of their maps with the upcoming releases. Until you receive an axyz file from AscendXYZ with the result of a map production request, this package adds no extra functionality. Stay tuned for more information in next release or contact us at support@ascend.xyz to get a current preview.
